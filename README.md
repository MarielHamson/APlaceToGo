## Proposal

Finding a safe restroom while out-and-about can be challenging for certain communities, such as people who don’t feel comfortable using gendered restrooms, or need extra space/accommodations. Trans/Gender Expansive/Intersex folks who use the restroom that best reflects their gender identity are often subject to ridicule and violence, or they just won’t go. Everyone has the right to safely use the restroom of their choice. This app is for anyone who has questioned whether their safety is on the line when they just need a place to go.

## Key Features

- Easy to use Navigation Bar
- Register/Login to account for chat feature (coming soon!)
- See all safe restrooms listed in your area

- Mobile Responsive Site

- Cross platform
  - Windows, macOS and Linux ready.
