## Dependencies / Libraries

styled components
mobx, react auto complete, react spring
create react app - api

## General Thoughts

Use Firestore, seed from Refuge Restroom API, full CRUD is possible!

work on UI a lot so it looks awesome.

Material but customized

User can search for restrooms using keywords or location

-- research API calls

9:00-10:20 -- trouble with firebase, created new project due to some errors with admin permissions, updating github, wiped my history from last friday.

10:30-11:00: Firebase is broken. Trying to add database is not allowed. Slightly freaking out but working on Material UI

11:00 - 1:05: Played with Material Design and nav bar templates for too long. Most were too complex for this project. Returning to work on functionality next

1:13: Found out my CORS extension was ruining my life. Wow.

1:00 - 3:00 worked on checkbox values not showing and import. Neither work still.

3:00 - 4:40: break
